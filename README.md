# The-Guess-Game
Game made in C

<b> Rules of the Game </b>

You have to input the limits between which you want to play this game, then a Random Value generator will generate one value and after that you will gues what is that value. If you guess a lower value then the real value the compiler will tell you to go for a higher value and similarly with the lower value but as soon as you guess the right value the compiler will tell you how many guesses it took you to guess the real value

<b>"Note : The random value will be inclusive of the upper and lower limit value"</b>

<b> TO-DO </b>
